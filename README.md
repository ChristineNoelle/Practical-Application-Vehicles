Purpose

1. Apply CRISP-DM Framework to Business Problem
2. Explore Kaggle Dataset (426K Cars)
3. Understand Factors Making A Car More Expensive or Less Expensive
4. Provide Results and Analyses to Used Car Dealership Client
5. Provide Clear Recommendations to Client, as to What Consumers Value in Used Car

Summary Description

Our intital data set included 18 attributes. We were tasked to identify features, both which make a used car more expensive or less expensive, and to optimize features for possible models. In this analysis of features or attributes, we should have beeen able to determine what consumers most value in a used car. To summarize, of the 18 attributes provided in the data set, we should have chosen which features were most meaningful to the consumer in terms of value. This process and outcome would aid the "fine-tuning" of inventory for a group of used car dealers.

We found in our multiple linear regression models and data exploration, that cars with lower odometer readings tended to sell for higher prices. Our multiple linear regression models also suggested that when odometer readings were low, transmission of other types - not manual or automatic - tended to sell at higher prices.

Not only did car price reflect what consumer valued, but also did amount, or quantities sold. Our data exploration when building the multiple regression models also revealed patterns for actionable suggestions.

In the time spent inspecting the data, plotting, cleaning, and exploring feature columns, and building multiple regression models there were resulting patterns. Objectives were met to make inventory suggestions and clear recommendations. These recommendations were made solely on patterns in the data set provided. The next decade's plan might include the monitoring and submitting of more data that would modify future recommendations.
